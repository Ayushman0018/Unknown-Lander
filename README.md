# Unknown-Lander
I tried re-creating a lost old PC game from my childhood memories. Would love feedback.

Hardware:-
You can either play with a keyboard, or use a connected gamepad. Any button on the gamepad will do the thing.

How to play:-

Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system.
Install pygame module using command -> "py -m pip install pygame"
Start the game.py file with python.

Controls:-
Press space on the right time to shoot a laser.

Game Objective:-
You are some unknown lander, who needs clear space to land. But the city underneath is an obstacle.
Your goal is to demolish all buildings on time and create a proper landing space. Remember, fuel if limited, and so it time.

After shooting a laser, your ship needs some time to recharge it. But you have unlimited shots.

Enjoy. Just don't crash!
